## Kodikon-2022
```
24hrs Hackathon conducted by the club Embrione PESU .
We were among the top 12 teams selected  out 210+ teams of participants.
```
## Problem statement : 

 Increasing the efficiency and expanding the reachability of
learning without any language barriers. 


## Solution: 
We are aiming more on quality of learning process rather than quantity regardless of background of the student viz.,
whether he is from rural regional language medium student or who is not offordable to it.
->Project Based Learning : This is the better and productive way of learning for all round development of students'
progress. There would be weekly based projects , demo videos and reviews at regular interval of time with regular
feedback to their research or completion of task
->Language Proficiency : The student reads aloud into a microphone what it sees on the screen. After five sentences,
the student should gets a reading and pronunciation score. The system evaluates the reading level after processing
the speech and making judgement of proficiency of the reader.
->Self Assessment in Regional Languages : In learning process "Regular Assessment" plays vital role. Self
assessment is the one which helps to take test according to their convenience , level of difficulty, language in
which they're comfortable in with in limited duration of time and relatable assessment pattern.
->Peer to Peer learning : This feature enhances learning process and increases collaborative learning amongst peer
group. Users can discuss concepts and many other study related stuffs and help each other.
->Teaching- Learning Marketplace/Volunteer matchmaking : Many students are hesitant to speak out to clear their doubts
at class. This platform covers it . One can reach out to teacher or Mentor (seniors ) and get their doubt solved .
->Updates on Scholarship and important nation wide exams

## Business Prospective
It has the ability to be helpful to many schools and colleges as it covers huge
audiences across the country and usage of technology. It enables new way of
learning in productive way regardless of language barrier and it perfectly fits
the aspects of NEP (proposed by govt. of India).
Our first target is to enable quality of education in better way than at
present scenario. Secondarily It has great ability to generate revenue from
our product by providing it either for free or at lowest cost possible which
attracks large audience . Eventually we might end up with profitable side


 ## Steps To Run Our Project :
 
 1.Install Django -  ``` pip install django ```
 
 2. Verifying the installation of Django 
    ``` python -m django --version ```
   
3.  Open Terminal and typw
 ``` cd .\mysite\ ```
 
4. To Run ```Django``` Server 
 ```  python manage.py runserver   ```
 
## To Create Your Own ```Django Project```,
  ``` django-admin startproject mysite ```
## Details of all files in ```Django``` 

 ## What Is ```__init__.py```?
```Django``` generates this file for us. It is mandatory to have an ```__inti__.py``` file in a directory to denote that the project is a python package and can be imported into other files. This file usually remains empty.
If this file gets missing, you will see a “package not found error” in the absence of this file.
 ## What Is ```settings.py```?
This is the core file of our ```Django``` projects.
It contains the configuration values which are needed by web apps to work properly, such as database settings, static files location, template location, etc. We will keep coming to this file to edit the project configuration throughout this course.
##What is ```urls.py```?
Url declaration and mapping are made under this file.
## What is ```wsgi.py```?
```WSGI``` stands for web-server gateway interface.
```WSGI``` is a specification that describes the communication between a web server and a web application.
## What is ```manage.py```?
Command-line utility for performing administrative tasks.
We will be using manage.py frequently while developing a ```Django project``` .
