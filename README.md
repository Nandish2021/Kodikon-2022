# Kodikon-2022
24hrs Hackathon conducted by the club Embrione PESU .
We were among the top 12 teams selected  out 210+ teams of participants.

-Problem statement : 
Increasing the efficiency and expanding the reachability of
learning without any language barriers.


Solution: 
We are aiming more on quality of learning process rather than quantity regardless of background of the student viz.,
whether he is from rural regional language medium student or who is not offordable to it.
->Project Based Learning : This is the better and productive way of learning for all round development of students'
progress. There would be weekly based projects , demo videos and reviews at regular interval of time with regular
feedback to their research or completion of task
->Language Proficiency : The student reads aloud into a microphone what it sees on the screen. After five sentences,
the student should gets a reading and pronunciation score. The system evaluates the reading level after processing
the speech and making judgement of proficiency of the reader.
->Self Assessment in Regional Languages : In learning process "Regular Assessment" plays vital role. Self
assessment is the one which helps to take test according to their convenience , level of difficulty, language in
which they're comfortable in with in limited duration of time and relatable assessment pattern.
->Peer to Peer learning : This feature enhances learning process and increases collaborative learning amongst peer
group. Users can discuss concepts and many other study related stuffs and help each other.
->Teaching- Learning Marketplace/Volunteer matchmaking : Many students are hesitant to speak out to clear their doubts
at class. This platform covers it . One can reach out to teacher or Mentor (seniors ) and get their doubt solved .
->Updates on Scholarship and important nation wide exams
